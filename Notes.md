## Starter Solution Outline Notes

Here's a simple outline with comments for a starter solution to the CSV processing exercise:

I've created a starter solution outline using comments to guide you through the CSV processing exercise.
This outline in `pipeline2.py`:

1. Shows the logical flow of the solution without providing the actual code
2. Includes helpful hints and reminders about data types and structure
3. Breaks down the task into clear steps:
   - Setting up necessary data structures
   - Reading the CSV file
   - Processing each row
   - Calculating statistics
   - Determining the best-performing store
   - Printing results

This approach gives you a framework to build your solution while requiring you to
write all the actual code yourself.
You'll need to apply your understanding of Python basics like file handling,
data structures, loops, and calculations.
